##Problem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses, it is most important to ensure maximization of profitability. 
Let's assume that you have an art gallery, how would you achieve the maximum
profitability while being efficient? <br />
>The goal of this project is to develop an efficient
algorithm that tells the owner of the art gallery what is the most optimal way 
of putting art paintings on the wall of the gallery in order to achieve 
the maximum potential profit.
